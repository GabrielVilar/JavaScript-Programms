            Comparison operators in JavaScript
    
    1. Equal to: "=="
    2. Not equal to: "!="
    3. Strict equal to: "==="
    4. Strict not equal to: "!=="
    5. Greater than: ">"
    6. Less than: "<"
    7. Greater than or equal to: ">="
    8. Less than or equal to: "<="

    More explanations:
        The "==" operator compares two values for equality, converting 
    their types if necessary. The "===" operator also compares 
    two values for equality, but without any type conversion.
        The ">" and "<" operators compare two values to determine whether 
    one is greater than or less than the other. The ">=" and "<=" operators
    compare two values to determine whether one is greater than or equal 
    to or less than or equal to the other.
        The "!=" operator checks if two values are not equal, while the 
    "!==" operator checks if two values are not strictly equal.

//Different ways of showing a message at the console in JavaScript
/*
    1. Using console.log() function: This is the most common way 
    of displaying messages in the console. You can use it to display 
    strings, variables, or objects. 
    For example:
*/
console.log("Hello, world!");
/*
    2. Using console.warn() function: This is used to display a warning 
    message in the console. 
    For example:   
*/
console.warn("This is a warning message!");
/*
    3.Using console.error() function: This is used to display an error 
    message in the console. 
    For example:
*/
console.error("This is an error message!");
/*
    4.Using console.info() function: This is used to display an 
    informational message in the console. 
    For example:
*/
console.info("This is an informational message!");
/*
    5.Using console.debug() function: This is used to display a debug 
    message in the console. 
    For example:
*/
console.debug("This is a debug message!");
/*
    All of these functions take a message as an argument, which can be 
    a string, variable, or object, and display it in the console.
