/*
A certain person is very fond of stamps. She keeps these stamps on a page and arranges them in a way that makes a completely covered rectangle with no overlap. 
Implement a function that takes the number of stamps in this person's collection and returns the number of ways to arrange the stamps into rectangles.
Ex: If the number 4 is passed, the expected return is 3.
