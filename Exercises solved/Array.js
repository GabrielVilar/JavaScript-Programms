/*
implement a JavaScript function that is able to execute the following command:
Given an array of 5 positive integers, find the minimum value and the maximum value that can be calculated by adding exactly four of the five numbers in that array.
Your function should return a list, with two elements, the first should be the value found for the minimum sum and the second should be the value found for the maximum sum.
Example:
If lst = [5, 2, 3, 4, 1] is passed then your function must return [10, 14].
Because 10 is the smallest value that can be obtained by adding 4 of the 5 values and 14 is the largest value that can be obtained by adding 4 of the 5 values in the lst array.
Remark:
There may be repeated numbers in this array.
